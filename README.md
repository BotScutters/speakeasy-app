# SpeakEasy App
## Overview

This is a source code for the flask app I created. The goal is to replicate the experience of having a professional mixologist craft a cocktail for you based on a vague description of what you want. It takes in a plain text request, transforms the request using natural language processing techniques, and compares it against a TF-IDF/SVA model that's been trained on a dataset of text about over 4,000 cocktails. Try ou the app [here](https://speakeasy-ai-bartender.herokuapp.com/).

The github repo for the project is [here](https://github.com/BotScutters/SpeakEasy), and the blog post on the project can be found [here]("https:www.scottbutters.com").
